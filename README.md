## Description

This module includes a Bolt plugin to generate Bolt targets from AWS EC2 instances.

## Requirements

You will need an `aws_access_key_id` and a `aws_secret_access_key` (see [providing aws credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/awsrbflowguide/set-up-creds.html)) in order to authenticate against aws API.

## Usage

The AWS Inventory plugin supports looking up running AWS EC2 instances. It supports several fields:

-   `profile`: The [named profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) to use when loading from AWS `config` and `credentials` files. (optional, defaults to `default`)
-   `region`: The region to look up EC2 instances from.
-   `credentials`: The path to an AWS credentials file to load. (optional, defaults to `~/.aws/credentials`)
-   `aws_access_key_id`: The AWS access key id to use. (optional)
-   `aws_secret_access_key`: The AWS secret access key to use. (optional)
-   `filters`: The [filter request parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInstances.html) used to filter the EC2 instances by. Filters are name-values pairs, where the name is a request parameter and the values are an array of values to filter by. (optional)
-   `target_mapping`: A hash of target attributes to populate with resource values. Tags can referenced with tag.\<key\> (e.g. tag.Name). The following attributes are available.
    - `config`: A bolt config map where the value for each config setting is an [EC2 instance attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/EC2/Instance.html).
    - `name`: The [EC2 instance attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/EC2/Instance.html) to use as the target name.
    - `uri`: The [EC2 instance attribute](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/Aws/EC2/Instance.html) to use as the target URI.

> **Note:** One of `uri` or `name` is required. If only `uri` is set, then the value of `uri` will be used as the `name`.

Accessing EC2 instances requires a region and valid credentials to be specified. The following locations are searched in order until a value is found:

**Region**

In order of precedence:

-   `region: <region>` in the inventory or config file
-   `ENV['AWS_REGION']`
-   `~/.aws/credentials`

**Credentials**

In order of precedence:

-   `credentials: <filepath>` in the inventory or config file
-   `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` in the inventory or config file
-   `ENV['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID']` and `ENV['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']`
-   `~/.aws/credentials`

If the region or credentials are located in a shared credentials file, a `profile` can be specified in the inventory file to choose which set of credentials to use. For example, if the inventory file were set to `profile: user1`, the second set of credentials would be used:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=...
aws_secret_access_key=...
region=...

[user1]
aws_access_key_id=...
aws_secret_access_key=...
region=...
```

AWS credential files stored in a non-standard location (`~/.aws/credentials`) can be configured in Bolt:

```
plugins:
  aws:
    credentials: ~/alternate_path/credentials
```

### Examples

`inventory.yaml`
```yaml
groups:
  - name: aws
    targets:
      - _plugin: aws_inventory
        profile: user1
        region: us-west-1
        filters:
          - name: tag:Owner
            values: [Devs]
          - name: instance-type
            values: [t2.micro, c5.large]
        target_mapping:
          name: public_dns_name
          uri: public_ip_address
          config:
            ssh:
              host: public_dns_name
              user: tag.User
    config:
      ssh:
        user: ec2-user
        private-key: ~/.aws/private-key.pem
        host-key-check: false
```
